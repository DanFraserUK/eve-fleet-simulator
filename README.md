# Eve Fleet Simulator

Eve Fleet Simulator(EFS) is an analysis tool for Eve Online.

Detailed Fleet PvP: EFS makes it easy to simulate PvP by using dynamic AI that mimics real player behaviour alongside a wide range of weapons and effect implementations.

Acessiblity and Versatility: Over 1000 pvp fits are periodically scraped from ![zkill]() and packaged with EFS. These represent some of the best preforming fits from the last 3-6 months. If you need something more specific however you can easily export your own fits from ![pyfa](). This makes it easy to test new ideas along with things like wormhole effects or exact skills and implants.

Hull Comparision: In ship mode you can quickly and easily select and sort every ship and subsystem configuration in Eve. This includes infomation about the hull once fited, for example effective hitpoints when armor brick tanked or max velocity with a T2 MWD.

# Installation

Use the ![EFS website]() to get all the features of EFS without needing to install anything.
If you prefer native applications, want to work offline or want to make sure you don't delete your custom fits from browser storage you can find EFS for Windows, OSX and Linux in the [releases section]().

# Getting started:
TODO: Write this.

# Building Eve Fleet Simulator:

Clone the repo: `git clone [EFS GITHUB URL HERE]()`
`cd eve_fleet_simulator`
Install EFS: `npm install`

The development build should now be in the `lib/` directory.

Running `production_build.js` will create the production builds for each platform in `dist/`.

The development build can be updated to reflect local changes by running either `build.js` or webpack.
