    It also allows for robust sorting and comparison for ships and ship fits.

    Creating new fleet doctrines, or tweaking existing ones.<br />
    Comparing the PvP effectiveness of different doctrines or compositions.<br />
    Determining the expected result of a potential engagement.<br />
    Easily and accurately working out the time required for ganks.<br />
    Determining the engagement range and profile of a fleet.<br />
    Helping to select and compare hull options for both PvP and PvE.<br />
    Answering novel questions like which X can fit the biggest armor
    tank or has the highest missile damage.

const faqAnswer3 = (
  <div>
    A perfect simulation of PvP fleet combat would require a re-implementation of Eve&apos;s
    entire combat system along with AI that perfectly matches actual player actions.<br />
    It would also still have to run at least a thousand times faster than the actual game.<br />
    With this in mind Eve Fleet Simulator is a partial implementation with an
    ongoing effort to more closely match in game behavior.<br />
    A list of mechanics and behaviors that have yet to be implemented can be
    found <a href="https://github.com/MaruMaruOO/eve-fleet-simulator/blob/master/resources/Limitations.md">here</a>.

    This indicates that the ship includes a corresponding module
    but EFS does not yet implement it&apos;s effects.<br />
    The fits details will include the module regardless but it can be helpful to know at a glance
    that a fit has nuets or a MJD, even if EFS doesn&apos;t yet simulate it&apos;s impact.<br />
    For more implementation information please see the
    <a href="https://github.com/MaruMaruOO/eve-fleet-simulator/blob/master/resources/Limitations.md"> list of known limitations </a>

    Imported fits are saved just for you. Specifically they are stored in your browsers local storage.

const faqAnswer8 = (
  <div>
    The AI doesn't swap off targets at this time. In order to change target priories you can either drag table rows or type it in.

const faqAnswer9 = (
  <div>
    No, to avoid giving one side an advantage EFS sequences actions so the side doesn&apos;t impact the outcome.<br />
    For example a tick will apply both sides weapons before either side removes loses.<br />
    Similarly ships will move based off where the opposing ships were in the previous tick.<br />
    This doesn't cause meaningful inaccuracies because EFS uses 50ms ticks that are shorter than most players pings to the server.

const faqAnswer10 = (
  <div>
    Yes, you can see most upcoming plans by looking at the
    <a href="https://github.com/MaruMaruOO/eve-fleet-simulator/issues"> GitHub issues page</a>.<br />
    You can also leave comments or post suggestions there.

const faqAnswer11 = (
  <div>
    Take a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/MaruMaruOO/eve-fleet-simulator/blob/master/resources/Limitations.md"> list of known limitations</a>.<br />
    If your query isn't impacted by anything listed then the implementation should match the game.<br />
    If it doesn't seem to match the list or game please open an
    <a href="https://github.com/MaruMaruOO/eve-fleet-simulator/issues"> issue on GitHub </a>so it can be fixed.

    Yes, in order to accommodate the Eve player base both these numbers are actually text boxes.<br />
    So press/click the number and type in that nice round figure.
  </div>
);

const faqAnswer13 = (
  <div>
    EFS uses it's own data format for imports, you can't export fits from zkill or the like.<br />
    You must export fits from pyfa using the EFS format (Edit -> To Clipboard -> EFS -> OK).<br />
    If you're doing this, pyfa is up to date and you still get the error, please report it as a bug.
  </div>
);

const faqAnswer14 = (
  <div>
    Each fit will position independently, selecting it's own anchor and following it around.<br />
    Ships will try to follow their anchor but opposing tackle can cause them to get separated and fall behind.<br />
    For specifics see the answer to "How does the AI determine at what range it wants to be at?".
  </div>
);

const faqAnswer15 = (
  <div>
    Ships with remote repair start locking as soon as a friendly takes damage.<br />
    After that they cycle the repairs, repairing at the start of the cycle for shields or the end for armor/hull.
    Target resistance is factored into the repair.<br />
    Repair scaling uses an approximate formula that should always be within 5%.
    In practice it's typically much closer, especially at large scales.<br />
    There's also a system in place to avoid massively over repairing and having the target die between cycles.
  </div>
);

const faqAnswer16 = (
  <div>
    Each fit tests to find it's ideal range every 10 simulated seconds.<br />
    Logi tries to take as little damage as possible while staying in repair range.<br />
    Support ships try and take as little damage as possible while also applying their ewar.
    If required support ships will also unanchor in order to keep applying ewar to their target/s.
    It's particularly common to see this when they are trying to spread scrams across the opposing fleet.<br />
    Damage dealers and other ships try to keep <code>damage done / damage taken</code> as high as possible.
    They will also prioritize keeping application over 30% if possible, so they won't shoot from deep falloff just because the ratio is higher.
  </div>
);

const faqAnswer17 = (
  <div>
    Make sure your phone is in landscape mode when browsing the EFS website on mobile.<br />
    A portrait mode is planned but for now landscape should hopefully work fairly well.<br />
    Mobile apps are possible if the demand is there but they are basically just a wrapper around a local copy of the website.
